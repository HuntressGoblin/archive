>[!galaxy] In the lands of story, there was once nothing. They say when the ink shifted, she did too. Istoria is many things, but even she recognizes that she is just another character in a story. Give her a chance, let her open a tome and read you a story.

 ***⚔️Istoria is a large woman-esk figure wearing a long purple cloak. She often wears a blank, white mask with empty sockets. However, she has no being or figure. Instead, she is made of ink. If you took off her cloak, it would be an inky mass of tendrils with no rhyme or reason. She swaps her mask at will, often imitating those in her tales as she narrates. While enjoying a good story, Istoria will never intervene unless... ...it makes for a good story.*** I am changing this. 

> [!galaxy]- Who/What is Istoria?
> Istoria is a "Domain Master." Despite any rumors, she is not made to represent anyone or anything. She functions as the Storyteller, as neutral as a force as one can get. If she ever intervenes, it's for the flow of the story itself.

> [!galaxy]- What are her rules?
> Istoria is a neutral storytelling force. If she intervenes, it's for the beauty of a story instead of personal feelings. Death and destruction make for a bleak ending, but difficulty can be an excellent way to encourage triumphs and a well-earned victory. Don't challenge her, but she ultimately does cheer for the heroes in her story.
