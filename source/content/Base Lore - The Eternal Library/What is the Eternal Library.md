> [!galaxy] Deep in the fabric of reality, behind every little action and detail, lies something that stretches endlessly for miles. Shelves full of tomes lie neatly organized, containing each small bit of data etched by feather quills and ink. They stretch like massive towers to unknown heights amongst a realm made of nothing... but ink. If you made it here, you either have truly made a deadly mistake and hit your last resort, you've truly gone mad, or enlightenment has decided to reach **you.**

The Eternal Library is a great expansive of shelves full of many tomes. Some tomes lie untouched, some unfinished, others fully done, but most are still being written. Within the endless expanse of both nothingness and ink, feather quills float to continue noting down every little detail in each story the Eternal Library holds. 

Every story is safely stored in the Eternal Library, watched over by a large figure cloaked in purple. Some refer to this figure as the "Domain Master," but others may refer to them as "[[Istoria, Lady of Ink]]." To see Istoria is to see madness itself, be wary not to see behind the paragraphs.
